====================

Code needed for building the data and learner for predicting chiptunes using
MIDI representations

Files
-----

    data/
        raw/*
            - All of the MIDI files that have been generated and collected so
              far
        all_songs/*
            - A subset of the *raw* directory that only includes songs that
              have been manually labeled as "songs", as opposed to empty
              tracks, sound effects or other background songs.
        training_songs/*
            - A subset of the *all_songs* directory, approx 2/3 of it,
              containing songs that should be used to generate and train
              the algorithm with.
        testing_songs/*
            - A subset of the *all_songs* directory, containing the approx
              1/3 of the songs that are not in the *training_songs* directory,
              that should be used for testing the accuracy of the algorithm
        training_counts.sqlite3
            - The generated sqlite3 database of transition counts (generated
              with the *training.py* file) based off the *training_songs*
              directory


Installing
----------

install python-midi by running:

 1.  `cd contrib/python-midi`
 2.  `python setup.py install`

install MIDIUtil by running:

 1.	 `cd contrib/MIDIUtil`
 2.  `python setup.py install`

You'll also want to generate some training counts.  You can do so with:

 1.  `python training.py`
